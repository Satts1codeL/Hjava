Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the code, line by line:


---

Code Breakdown

1. import java.util.Scanner;

This imports the Scanner class from the java.util package, which is used to take user input in the program.



2. class icse2019q5 {

Declares a class named icse2019q5. The class is the blueprint for the program.



3. public static void main(String args[]) {

Defines the main method, the entry point of the program.

The public keyword makes it accessible to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

static means it can be called without creating an object of the class.

String args[] is used to pass command-line arguments (not used here).



4. Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

Creates a Scanner object sc to read input from the standard input stream (System.in).



5. System.out.println("[a] Show letters and unicode");

Prints the first menu option [a] Show letters and unicode.



6. System.out.println("[b] Show number triangle");

Prints the second menu option [b] Show number triangle.



7. System.out.print("Your choice? ");

Prompts the user to input their choice (either a/A or b/B).



8. char ch = sc.next().charAt(0);

Reads the user input as a string using sc.next() and extracts the first character of the string using charAt(0).



9. switch(ch)

Begins a switch statement to handle different cases based on the value of ch.



10. case 'a': and case 'A':

Executes the block of code below if ch is 'a' or 'A'.

This ensures the input is case-insensitive for the 'a' option.



11. System.out.println("Letter\tUnicode");

Prints a header for the output table with two columns: "Letter" and "Unicode".

The \t is a tab character to align the output neatly.



12. for (int i = 65; i <= 90; i++)

A for loop initializes i to 65 and iterates until i reaches 90 (inclusive).

The numbers 65 to 90 are the Unicode values for uppercase English letters A to Z.



13. System.out.println((char)i + "\t" + i);

Converts the integer i to its corresponding character using (char)i and prints it alongside its Unicode value (i).

Each iteration prints a letter and its Unicode value in a new line.



14. break;

Exits the switch statement after executing the code for the 'a'/'A' case.



15. case 'b': and case 'B':

Executes the block of code below if ch is 'b' or 'B'.

Again, this makes the input case-insensitive for the 'b' option.



16. for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)

Outer loop runs 5 times, from i = 1 to i = 5, for each row of the triangle.



17. for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)

Inner loop runs i times for each row.

Prints numbers starting from 1 to the value of the outer loop variable i.



18. System.out.print((j) + " ");

Prints the value of j followed by a space.

The numbers are displayed horizontally for each row.



19. System.out.println();

Moves to the next line after printing numbers for a row, creating the triangle shape.



20. break;

Exits the switch statement after executing the code for the 'b'/'B' case.



21. default:

This block executes if ch is neither 'a'/'A' nor 'b'/'B'.



22. System.out.println("Not an option");

Prints an error message indicating the input was invalid.



23. sc.close();

Closes the Scanner object to release the resources associated with it.

Example Execution

Input:

If user inputs a:

[a] Show letters and unicode
[b] Show number triangle
Your choice? a
Letter    Unicode
A         65
B         66
...
Z         90

If user inputs b:

[a] Show letters and unicode
[b] Show number triangle
Your choice? b
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5

If user inputs an invalid option:

[a] Show letters and unicode
[b] Show number triangle
Your choice? x
Not an option
